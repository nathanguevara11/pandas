    "# PyCity Schools Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this pandas challenge we analyzed the data of a school district and looked at the performance levels of of the dictrict and each school within it based on percentage passing scores (70% or higher) for math and reading. We drew conlusions based on the percentage scores and considered coorelations between scores and school types (District, charter), school budget, and other factors. \n",
    "\n",
    "What we found was that charter schools tended to have higher percentages of overall pass rates than district schools in every percentage category. On top of that, charter schools tended to have lower school sizes and lower spending per student; the data shows that 7 out the the 8 charter schools were in the bottom two per student spending ranges and ranges by school size repectively (The one exception for both ranges being Thomas High School which, while being on the upper ranges of per student spending and school size, still boasts impressive pass rates in every metric), with Bailey High School the only district school in the lower spending ranges, however, their passing rtes seem to fit more in other district schools than with charter schools. The data regarding percentage scores by grade level we very consistent based on school, there was not much deviation of specific percentage scpres by grade. \n",
    "The data suggests that charter schools far outperform district school, and this can be for many reasons. One reason could be because charter schools tend to have students that were specifically enrolled or recruited with education in mind, thus the faculty, as well as the students, are invested in academic success, while on the other hand district school students and faculty may be less motivated to engage in academics since they could just be there by requirement of the law. Another reason could be efficient spending and more immersed learning. Since there are fewer students in the chrter school, the students may have an easier time engaging with the material and thier class, with imporves their learning, while in district schools the larger school sizes most likely means large classrooms that water down any immersiveness the chilren have with the material, leading them to decrease in academic performance. Due to children inately being more inclined to learn in small learning environments, charter school budget requires less budget spending, and there could even be other factors such as perental involvement, positive student well-being, among other things. District schools may struggle with student assistance even though they recieve more money per student because factors like large and incondusive classrooms, along with students personal well-being, may leave district schools needing more money and rescources if they want to bridge the gap and positively impact thier students. \n",
